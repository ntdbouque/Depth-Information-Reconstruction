# Depth-Information-Reconstruction
# Introduction:
These notebooks perform the depth information construction problem to extract features and simulate depth from a pair of images using different computational methods such as Pixel-wise matching, window-based matching, and comparison using Cosine Similarity and Correlation Coeffiecient.
# Usage:
- Download 4 notebooks to resolve problems: building disparity_map function with pixel-wise matching and window-based matching, compare pixel relation between 2 images
- Run the code from top to bottom to perform resolving these problems
